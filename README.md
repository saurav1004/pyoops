# Python OOP Concepts

This repository is a collection of Python scripts each illustrating a specific concept of object-oriented programming (OOP). The scripts are organized to progressively cover the basics of encapsulation, constructors, class attributes, instance attributes, methods, decorators, class methods, static methods, magic methods, abstract classes, method overloading, and the use of `super`.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, you should have Python installed on your system. Each script is a standalone example of the OOP concept it represents. You can run each script individually to see the concept in action.

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```
